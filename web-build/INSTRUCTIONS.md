- Replace GodSVG.pck in the /Latest folder with the latest .pck web export (Unless you're doing testing)

- Add a new folder with the release name, and add the GodSVG.pck file to it.

- The parameter at the end of the url '?Version=' is editable, and will by default be set to "Latest". 
  If you want to send a specific version to someone, just replace it with the name of the version's folder
  Example:
    '?Version=1.0-alpha2" - This will send you to the current build as of writing this.

# ENGINE UPDATES
- Replace the .wasm file for the engine with the new version's file.
